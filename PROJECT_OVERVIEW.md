# Project: AptosAgents - Autonomous DeFi Agent Marketplace

## üöÄ The Concept

AptosAgents is a decentralized platform that enables users to create, deploy, and monetize AI-powered autonomous agents that perform various DeFi operations on the Aptos blockchain. Think of it as the **"AWS Lambda for DeFi"** but with intelligent agents that can make decisions, execute complex strategies, and adapt to market conditions.

## üéØ Why This Idea is Perfect for Both Opportunities

### **For the Ctrl+Move Hackathon ($100K Prize Pool):**
- **Perfect fit for "New Financial Products" track** - Creates entirely new category of automated DeFi services
- **Leverages Aptos' unique capabilities** - Utilizes parallel execution for simultaneous agent operations
- **Trading & Market Infrastructure** - Agents can perform sophisticated trading strategies
- **Payments & Value Transfer** - Agents can handle automated payment flows and treasury management

### **For Aptos Foundation Grants:**
- **Open-Source Impact**: Platform and agent templates will be fully open-source
- **Innovation with Move**: Leverages Move's resource model for secure agent state management
- **Project Maturity**: Can show MVP with working agents and clear scaling path
- **Execution Readiness**: Clear roadmap and budget allocation plan

## ‚ú® Core Features

### **1. Agent Creation Studio**
- **No-code interface** for users to create custom DeFi agents
- **Pre-built templates** for common strategies (yield farming, arbitrage, portfolio rebalancing)
- **Visual workflow builder** for complex multi-step strategies
- **AI-powered strategy suggestions** based on market conditions

### **2. Autonomous Agent Types**

- **Social Trading Agents**: Mirror successful traders' strategies
- **DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) Agents**: Execute recurring investment strategies

### **3. Agent Marketplace**
- **Agent NFT System**: Each agent is represented as an NFT with unique capabilities
- **Revenue Sharing**: Agent creators earn fees from users who deploy their agents
- **Performance Analytics**: Track and display agent performance metrics
- **Agent Staking**: Users stake APT tokens to access premium agents
- **Community Voting**: Community can vote on featured agents and improvements

### **4. Advanced AI Integration**

- **Predictive Analytics**: Agents can anticipate market movements and adjust strategies

### **5. Cross-Protocol Integration**
- **Native Aptos DEXs**: Thala, PancakeSwap, Hippo, Econia
- **Lending Protocols**: Aries Markets, other lending platforms
- **Yield Farming**: Integration with various farming opportunities
- **Cross-chain Bridges**: Enable agents to work across multiple chains (using Circle's CCTP)
